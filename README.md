Another version of demo was developing, in the structure of React & Node.js & Python.
Connecting Python file data to Node.js with Pythonshell was successful.
by using command
### node ./server/server.js
you can turn on the server in 3002 port and make the test.py's output go into the server.


Connecting React&Node.js was also succeessful.
by using command
### npm start
you can turn on the client then upload the image on react.

However, there was some technical problems in exporting images' url from react to .py file, so except that part everything was completed.
